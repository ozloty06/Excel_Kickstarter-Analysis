# Kicking Off A Successful Kickstarter Play Campaign

## OVERVIEW
Louise is interested in better understanding past Kickstarter campaigns as she prepares to launch her own play and is interested in seeking crowdfunding. The purpose of this report is to summarize a technical analysis completed to study the results of various Kickstarter campaigns based on launch dates and fundraising goals, specifically campaigns for plays. 

## METHODOLOGY
### Outcomes Based on Launch Date
To understand how Kickstarter campaigns fared based on their launch date, a pivot table and chart was created. The results were organized in descending order to show "successful" campaigns listed first. The pivot table was filtered to focus on "theatre" campaigns, as Louise is interested in launching a theatre campaign. 

### Outcomes Based on Goals
To understand how Kickstarter campaigns fared based on goal dollar amount, we counted total campaigns based on $5000 regular intervals of goal amounts. We compared the percent success, failed or cancelled within each interval to determine where Louise may want to target her goal. Aside from double checking the correct filtering of the data to ensure we were looking at "theatres" or "plays" specifically, no challenges or difficulties were encountered in this analysis.

## RESULTS
### Outcomes Based on Launch Date 
According to our analysis of Outcomes based on Launch Date, successful theatre campaigns tend to be launched in spring, peaking in May. It is likely best for Louise to launch a theatre campaign in May. Campaign success plummets in December, so that may be a less optimal time to launch.

### Outcomes Based on Goals 
While generally higher goals yield greater success up to $45,000, there's an uncanny valley of increased failure for campaigns with goals between $30,000 and $40,000. Due to the low count of plays at this goal level.

### Additional Notes
As there are only about 1000 campaigns in the "plays" subcategory, the number of plays with higher goals is relatively small and so the data shows increased volatility that may be attributed to few data points. 

In closing, additional analysis could be conducted, including looking at more recent data to see if recent trends vary from historic trends, focus on geographic area analysis to ensure we're representing the area of interest to Louise, or even take a look at campaign duration to determine if there's an ideal length for a Kickstarter campaign in general or with "plays" specifically.
